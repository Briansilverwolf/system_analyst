project_name='Personal Expense Tracker' business_need="A Personal Expense Tracker system that allows users to quickly record, view, and update their daily spending in simple files. The system should provide functionalities such as writing structured entries to a dated JSON file under an /expenses folder, listing or reading those files to show today's totals, editing existing entries to correct mistakes, and automatically adding follow-up tasks such as reimbursements to a /todos.txt file. This system will serve as a realistic, everyday scenario for testing file creation, reading, listing, editing, and todo-writing without needing any real financial data." sponsors=[Sponsor(id=UUID('d0ecb88a-9843-4d28-9094-52f6cd32f5d2'), name='Project Sponsor', role='Project Sponsor')] business_requirements=[BusinessRequirement(id=UUID('5cd9f992-f185-4572-a76b-59211b460f3e'), capability='Create and write structured entries to a dated JSON file under an /expenses folder'), BusinessRequirement(id=UUID('4039a537-c0b2-4f62-9720-b1ad25c29d35'), capability="List or read files in the /expenses folder to show today's totals"), BusinessRequirement(id=UUID('135a4557-64b3-4ee7-ab3f-6934d518887a'), capability='Edit existing entries in the /expenses folder to correct mistakes'), BusinessRequirement(id=UUID('4dec42e0-955b-4f53-bb98-e12a37e550a9'), capability='Automatically add follow-up tasks such as reimbursements to a /todos.txt file'), BusinessRequirement(id=UUID('f7480ab2-f7bd-4ea8-b756-04963965de52'), capability='Test file creation, reading, listing, editing, and todo-writing without needing real financial data.')] business_values=[BusinessValue(id=UUID('82c7f44f-47ea-4168-a527-75c9ac788c03'), value='Users can easily manage their daily spending.'), BusinessValue(id=UUID('3a8dd4b6-0c5f-45bd-93ef-fe7c460998de'), value='The system provides a realistic scenario for testing file operations.')] special_issues=[SpecialIssue(id=UUID('0995c51a-055e-4d15-96f1-e76b14463cf7'), issue='No real financial data required for testing.')]
